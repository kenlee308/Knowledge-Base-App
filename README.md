# Knowledge Base App
**Origin:** Original Work (Based on Electron-Vite template)  
**Type:** Electron Desktop App  

**Description:**  
A local-first personal knowledge management application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript, designed as an accessible alternative to tools like Obsidian. It empowers users—from industrial engineers to AI enthusiasts—to organize ideas through wikilinks, graph views, and daily notes, fostering AI literacy by enabling structured knowledge building for workforce upskilling. Developed by Kenny Lee, a founder-engineer with over a decade in industrial product management (electric motors and power systems), this app applies principles of connectivity and optimization from applied physics to help non-traditional professionals (e.g., in manufacturing or robotics) capture and visualize insights, aligning with the U.S. Department of Labor's AI Literacy Framework for collaborative, ethical knowledge sharing.

**Key Features:**  
- **Local Vaults:** Securely manages Markdown files offline, prioritizing privacy for sensitive workforce data.  
- **Graph View:** Visualizes note connections to reveal patterns, ideal for AI-driven problem-solving training.  
- **Wikilinks:** Seamless `[[Note Name]]` linking for intuitive knowledge navigation.  
- **Daily Notes:** Supports journaling to track learning progress in AI and technical skills.

**How to Use:**  
1. Install Dependencies: Run `npm install` in the `knowledge-base-app` directory.  
2. Run Development: Run `npm run dev` to start the app in development mode.  
3. Build: Run `npm run build:win` to create a Windows executable.  
4. Open Vault: Point the app to a folder of Markdown files to start browsing, editing, and building your AI literacy toolkit.  

**Alignment Note:** This project supports government grants by providing free, open-source tools for AI education in practical contexts, such as upskilling manufacturing workers in knowledge management for AI integration.
